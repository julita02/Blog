      "content": "Tirana, Albania. Not a place where many people decide to spend their holidays, and it doesn’t usually feature on the itineraries of people backpacking through Europe. Tirana isn’t the glitziest of destinations, nor is Albania the easiest country to travel around as a novice backpacker. Its infrastructure is pretty poor, things don’t always run on schedule and it isn’t yet used to catering to hordes of international tourists. Added to that, Albanians have a bit of a reputation of being the tough guys of Europe, with the Albanian mafia having ‘one of the highest criminal capacities in the world.‘ Albania then, is a country that many people consider to be undeveloped, dangerous, and not worth the hassle.

      "content": "The city centre is within easy reach either by train or tram, but be aware they’ll be absolutely packed. We recommend staying in one of the city centre hotels such as the NH, right opposite the main station. Double rooms come at around 120EUR per night, but there are plenty of cheaper or more upmarket options around. Next to the station and well worth a visit is the German Football museum. Opened in 2015 the museum covers the history of German football. Tickets are priced 15eur and the museum gives you a great interactive inside into the Germany’s football past.\n\nOther than that, and here, I am not talking around the block the centre isn’t pretty or quaint and there’s isn’t much to see. Dortmund used to be steelworkers and coal miners town. So, if you want sightseeing, head to Venice.",
